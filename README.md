# BloodBankDatabaseManagementSystem

ABSTRACT:
It can be hard to find blood donors all in one place due to multiple different organizations that host donation events. 
We want to be able to create a database that maintains this information on one database. Donors can enter their information 
along with blood type to make it easier for those that need blood donations or an easy look up can find the donor and their 
information that matches. This will serve as a communication tool between the receiver and the donor. We want to create a 
database that contains information of those that donated blood at different blood donation events in a state and contain that
info all in one place for convenience. MySQL is used as the primary database management system for the records of the donors.
The database application system will use a variety of scripting languages to simplify the querying of data for the hospitals,
as well as create a user-friendly environment on the client side of the database. Our end goal of this project is to create a
clearly structured database with a simple, easily operable database application program which can be used on hospitals across 
a particular state. In addition to this we will create an easy access web form for donors to enter information that can then 
be accessed by the appropriate facilities.
